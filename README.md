# Sentiment-analysis
In this project, sentiment analysis was conducted on IMDB movie reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The objective was to automatically categorize reviews into positive or negative sentiments. Data preprocessing involved tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, and lemmatization. Features were extracted using bag-of-words (BoW) and TF-IDF methods, and machine learning algorithms were employed for classification. The model achieved high accuracy in categorizing reviews, demonstrating its potential for automating sentiment analysis in movie reviews.
